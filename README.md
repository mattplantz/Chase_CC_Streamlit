# Chase_CC_Streamlit
The goal of this application is to create an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) environment for credit card charges. The application was created with the output from a Chase credit card in mind. Because of this, the following columns are required for functionality:  
                    - **Transaction Date**: Date of transaction  
                    - **Description**: Description of charge  
                    - **Category**: General category of charge  
                    - **Type**: Sale or Payment. Sale = charge to card; payment = payment of card balance  
                    - **Amount**: Value of sale or payment     
             The application contains four pages:  
                 - **Homepage**: Description of application, inputs, and requirements  
                 - **Upload Landing Page**: Landing page to upload CSV files containing statement data  
                 - **Query Module**: Interface allowing for SQL-like querying of statement data  
                 - **Visualization**: Module containing multiple premade visualizations of statement data  
            Please note a sample CSV has been provided to demonstrate the file format necessary as well as provide a sample for an introduction to the application.
